put 
if i want to change myfirst name then send put request for Update

{ "first": "Nazmul", "last": "hasan" } 

but here has one problem is put request that when i want to send put request i have to send all two parameters 
is first and last so it is mandatory to send all value again

patch :
patch request says . only send the data which one you want to update and it won't effecting or changing other
data .So no need to send all value again, just i want to update my first name so i need to send only first 
name to update.
